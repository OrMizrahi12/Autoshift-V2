# User Story Guide

## INVEST Criteria
User Stories should follow the INVEST criteria to create high-quality tasks:

1.  **Independent**: User stories should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story.
2.  **Negotiable**: Look for opportunities to discuss the story. It isn't a contract.
3.  **Valuable**: A user story must deliver value to the end-user.
4.  **Estimable**: You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.
5.  **Small**: User stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize within a level of accuracy.
6.  **Testable**: The user story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.

## Writing Format
The standard format for writing user stories is:

**Template**:
> As a <role>, I want to <feature> so that <benefit>.

**Example**:
> As a *new user*, I want to *sign up with my email address* so that I can *access the platform*.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria (AC) defines the boundaries of a user story and is used to verify when a story is completed and working as intended.

**Format**:
*   *Given* [pre-condition]
*   *When* [action]
*   *Then* [result]

**Example AC**:
*   Given the user is on the sign-up page.
*   When they enter a valid email and matching passwords.
*   Then the user is redirected to the dashboard.
*   And a confirmation email is sent.
